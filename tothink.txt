- Instead of using a vector and match PROFILE_FIELDS | ENTITY_FIELDS values to the indexes, what about just

using a switch case statement + ostream to create custom labels by checking all desired fields?
this way we can keep both the values and switch case approach which i find more readable

another approach would be using n^2 values so that we can overload & and do something like:
FIELDS & specific_field && label << "Specific field: " << profile.specific_field << std::endl; 
FIELDS & other_field && label << "Other field: " << profile.other_field << std::endl;
and so on...

we don't actually need the index approach since we know the csv headers, so we can just load Profiles / Entities to 
their structures and avoid more overloads
