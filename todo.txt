- *In subparsers* Add a function that does the if(opts.empty()){PERROR; PHINT} to avoid code duplication on every action that requires a profile name
this could also be avoided if i do what i wrote in tothink.txt about interactive versions of each action so that when no args given the interactive action 
gets called instead, which will prompt the user
- Implement create_pack(inline|splitted)
- Add some csv check for file modifications not made by 'gpki' (store timestamps in a file??) 
- Fix openssl command not working in Windows (both system() and CreateProcessA() fail executing the openssl command but if you copy paste it it works)
- Add dependency check on startup (openssl,openvpn) - also do not make openvpn strictly required (just for the tls keys generation)
