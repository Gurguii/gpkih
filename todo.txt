- Implement create_pack(inline|splitted)
- Add some csv check for file modifications not made by 'gpki' (store timestamps in a file??) 
- Fix openssl command not working in Windows (both system() and CreateProcessA() fail executing the openssl command but if you copy paste it it works)
- Add dependency check on startup (openssl,openvpn) - also do not make openvpn strictly required (just for the tls keys generation)
